Local diffusions
================

This is a working repository for the tutorial 

    Local diffusion algorithms for fast, personalized graph applications
    David F. Gleich and Kyle Kloster
    Graph Models and Complex Networks School at WAW2015.
    
and probably more in the future!

To get started, look at 

* GettingStarted.ipynb

which will walk you through setting up Julia to run the demos. 
(All the packages are standard and should work on OSX and Linux
and likely windows too!)

At the moment, it's pretty raw and I'll try to put in more documentation.

* PageRankDiffusion.ipynb
* KatzDiffusion.ipynb
* HeatKernelDiffusion.ipynb
* Local Clustering.ipynb

But you can play around with examples of these diffusions!

The raw code is in the `.jl` files.
