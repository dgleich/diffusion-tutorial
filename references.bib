  abstract = {Community detection is an important task in network analysis. A community
	(also referred to as a cluster) is a set of cohesive vertices that
	have more connections inside the set than outside. In many social
	and information networks, these communities naturally overlap. For
	instance, in a social network, each vertex in a graph corresponds
	to an individual who usually participates in multiple communities.
	One of the most successful techniques for finding overlapping communities
	is based on local optimization and expansion of a community metric
	around a seed set of vertices. In this paper, we propose an efficient
	overlapping community detection algorithm using a seed set expansion
	approach. In particular, we develop new seeding strategies for a
	personalized PageRank scheme that optimizes the conductance community
	score. The key idea of our algorithm is to find good seeds, and then
	expand these seed sets using the personalized PageRank clustering
	procedure. Experimental results show that this seed set expansion
	approach outperforms other state-of-the-art overlapping community
	detection methods. We also show that our new seeding strategies are
	better than previous strategies, and are thus effective in finding
	good overlapping clusters in a graph.},

	the ranking of Web pages by Web search engines. Based on relations
	in interconnected networks, pagerank has become a major tool for
	addressing fundamental problems arising in general graphs, especially
	for large information networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes.
	A notable notion of pagerank, introduced by Brin and Page and denoted
	by PageRank, is based on random walks as a geometric sum. In this
	paper, we consider a notion of pagerank that is based on the (discrete)
	heat kernel and can be expressed as an exponential sum of random
	walks. The heat kernel satisfies the heat equation and can be used
	to analyze many useful properties of random walks in a graph. A local
	Cheeger inequality is established, which implies that, by focusing
	on cuts determined by linear orderings of vertices using the heat
	kernel pageranks, the resulting partition is within a quadratic factor
	of the optimum. This is true, even if we restrict the volume of the
	small part separated by the cut to be close to some specified target
	value. This leads to a graph partitioning algorithm for which the
	running time is proportional to the size of the targeted volume (instead
	of the size of the whole graph).},

	in the worst-case, as it requires probing the link server for Ω(n)

	from nodes of high in-degree and/or from slow convergence of the
	PageRank random walk. We show that when the graph has bounded in-degree

	can be done using a small number of queries. Unfortunately, natural
	graphs, such as the web graph, are abundant with high in-degree nodes,
	making this algorithm (or any other local approximation algorithm)
	too costly. On the other hand, reverse natural graphs tend to have
	low in-degree while maintaining fast PageRank convergence. It follows
	that calculating Reverse PageRank locally is frequently more feasible
	than computing PageRank locally. We demonstrate that Reverse PageRank

Pan et al. (2004) define a random walk with restart, which is exactly a personalized PageRank system, to infer captions for a database of images. Given a set of images labeled by captions, define a graph where each image is connected to its regions, each region is connected to other regions via a similarity function, and each image is connected to the terms in its caption. A query image is a distribution over regions, and we find terms by solving a PageRank problem with this image as the teleportation vector. These graphs are weighted and undirected.

	role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing
	of genomes and their comparative analysis, complete descriptions
	of interactomes and their comparative analysis is fundamental to
	a deeper understanding of biological processes. A first step in such
	an analysis is to align two or more PPI networks. Here, we introduce
	an algorithm, IsoRank, for global alignment of multiple PPI networks.
	The guiding intuition here is that a protein in one PPI network is
	a good match for a protein in another network if their respective
	sequences and neighborhood topologies are a good match. We encode
	this intuition as an eigenvalue problem in a manner analogous to
	Google's PageRank method. Using IsoRank, we compute a global alignment
	of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis
	elegans, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens PPI networks. We demonstrate
	that incorporating PPI data in ortholog prediction results in improvements
	over existing sequence-only approaches and over predictions from
	local alignments of the yeast and fly networks. Previous methods
	have been effective at identifying conserved, localized network patterns
	across pairs of networks. This work takes the further step of performing
	a global alignment of multiple PPI networks. It simultaneously uses
	sequence similarity and network data and, unlike previous approaches,
	explicitly models the tradeoff inherent in combining them. We expect
	IsoRank---with its simultaneous handling of node similarity and network
	similarity---to be applicable across many scientific domains.},

  abstract = {<p>High-throughput Structural Genomics yields many new protein structures
	without known molecular function. This study aims to uncover these
	missing annotations by globally comparing select functional residues
	across the structural proteome. First, Evolutionary Trace Annotation,
	or ETA, identifies which proteins have local evolutionary and structural
	features in common; next, these proteins are linked together into
	a proteomic network of ETA similarities; then, starting from proteins
	with known functions, competing functional labels diffuse link-by-link
	over the entire network. Every node is thus assigned a likelihood
	<italic>z-</italic>score for every function, and the most significant
	one at each node wins and defines its annotation. In high-throughput
	controls, this competitive diffusion process recovered enzyme activity
	annotations with 99% and 97% accuracy at half-coverage for the third
	and fourth Enzyme Commission (EC) levels, respectively. This corresponds
	to false positive rates 4-fold lower than nearest-neighbor and 5-fold
	lower than sequence-based annotations. In practice, experimental
	validation of the predicted carboxylesterase activity in a protein
	from S<italic>taphylococcus aureus</italic> illustrated the effectiveness
	of this approach in the context of an increasingly drug-resistant
	microbe. This study further links molecular function to a small number
	of evolutionarily important residues recognizable by Evolutionary
	Tracing and it points to the specificity and sensitivity of functional
	annotation by competitive global network diffusion. A web server

  annote = {Arguably the first ``PageRank''-like metric defined, Katz suggests
	a method based on path attenuation to compute a status index ``in
	a manner free from the deficiencies of popularity and contest procedures.''
	Their analysis uses a sociometric ``choice matrix.'' The choice matrix
	$C$ has entries $c_{ij} = 1$ when person $i$ chooses person $j$ and
	$c_{ij} = 0$ otherwise, the entries $c_{ii} = 0$. Rather than assume
	that the given choice matrix is accurate, they assume that each link
	has an effectiveness probability $a$ so a path of length $k$ has
	effectiveness $a^k$. Katz does not address the question of how to
	choose $a$ and simply assume that it is known. The status indicator
	are based on the column sums of the matrix \[ T = aC + (aC)^2 + (aC)^3
	+ \ldots = (I-aC)^{-1} - I. \] The column sums of $T$ are $t = (e^T
	T)^T = T^T e$ or \[ (I - aC^T) t = a C^T e. \] This equation becomes
	\[ \left(\frac{1}{a} I + C^T\right)t = s, \] where $s$ is the vector
	of column sums of $C$. This equation is extremely similar to the
	PageRank equation \[ (I - \alpha A^T D^{+}) x = \frac{1}{n} e. \]
	To compute the status indices, Katz suggests normalizing $t$ by the
	weighted number of choices \[ m = a(n-1) + a^2 (n-1)^{(2)} + a^3
	(n-1)^{(3)} + \ldots \approx (n-1)! a^{n-1} e^{\frac{1}{a}}. \] This
	normalization is irrelevant for ranking as it does not change the
	ordering. Immedately, this work suggests comparing the ranks to those
	computed with PageRank.},
